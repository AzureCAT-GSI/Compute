# Compute
This session equips the Solution Architect with essential knowledge to leverage compute options the Azure platform provides in various application scenarios.  Learn how to deploy virtual machines, customize images, and attach disks to support your most demanding workloads.  Next, understand how to use platform-as-a-service options for web apps, web jobs, mobile apps, Docker containers, and service fabric.  And finally, see how to capture the promise of elasticity that cloud computing makes by auto-scaling your solutions.
